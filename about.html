        About Us
      </h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin:30px">
        Becoming a nurse is not the only option that a nursing student has. Now, a lot of nursing students 
        complete their higher education and specialise in a field of medicine. This increases their demand 
        and employment rates. Nurses are also given the responsibility of becoming supervisors and managers 
        in various hospitals. They also get into teaching; since there are many medical institutes in our country, 
        they have a great chance of finding jobs. Research is also a possible option to explore.
      </p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; margin:10px">Scope of Nursing in India and Abroad</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 30px">
        Nursing course is a very well established field in India. Many students apply for nursing all over India. 
        Since the field of healthcare has a lot of demand and popularity in India, the nursing course has great 
        participation. Nurses perform major duties and roles in a hospital. They attend to patients 24/7. They are 
        the backbones of the healthcare sectors.<br><br>
        In India, nurses are not only employed in hospitals, but they are also hired across various wellness centres 
        and holistic healing centres. Few individuals hire nurses at homes to attend to a patient's everyday health 
        needs. Nurses have great demand all over the country. The healthcare industry would cease to function if nurses 
        stopped working. The whole industry is dependent on Nursing group of individuals.<br><br>
        Even outside, nurses are in great demand. Every single country that has a well-established healthcare sector have 
        great demand for nurses. Since all individuals require healthcare, nurses are employed to attend to patients at 
        the primary level. They prepare the patients for procedures and help the patients during their time in the hospital. 
        They take care of the patient's needs and give them their required medicines. The scope for nurses will continue to do well. 
        Even though there are millions of people enrolling in nursing courses around the world, there is still a scarcity of nurses. 
        This increasing demand will result in nurses being paid well and at much higher rates in the coming years. 
      </p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold">Upcoming trends</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 30px">
        In the coming years, we will see the demand for nursing increases. Since they are a lot more people enrolling to be doctors and physicians, 
        the nursing student percentage will decrease. This is going to result in a rise in demand for nurses.
        We can see the salaries of nurses increasing. There will be an implementation of policies that will ensure that nurses have 
        reasonable hours of work and salaries. Nurses will have fixed hours of work and would not have to work overtime. They will begin to get work benefits soon.
        Nurses who have certain specialisations will become common over the years. Nursing students will have to complete higher studies. They might even require 
        specialisation if they wish to work. Such developments and trends are to be expected. In a nutshell, the demand for this field will increase, 
        but it is most likely for students to enrol for other medicine courses.
